# Docker Compose Base Configuration

# > Understanding multiple Compose files
# >
# > By default, Compose reads two files, a `docker-compose.yml` and an optional
# > `docker-compose.override.yml` file. By convention, the `docker-compose.yml` contains your base
# > configuration. The override file, as its name implies, can contain configuration overrides for
# > existing services or entirely new services.
# >
# > If a service is defined in both files, Compose merges the configurations using the rules
# > described in Adding and overriding configuration.
