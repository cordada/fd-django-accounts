"""Authentication backends for :func:`django.contrib.auth.authenticate`.

This module allows using a custom user model for authentication and
authorization when ``django.contrib.auth`` is not in ``INSTALLED_APPS``,
because that app will still play a significant (although subtle) role.

Why? Because, unfortunately, the default authentication backend
:class:`django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend` requires that the chosen
auth user model is a subclass of
:class:`django.contrib.auth.models.AbstractUser`, which is an extremely
opinionated user model, unlike
:class:`django.contrib.auth.base_user.AbstractBaseUser`.

The provided backend :class:`AuthUserModelAuthBackend` does not require that
the project where it is used has :class:`fd_dj_accounts.models.User`
set as its auth user model.

Notes:
- It is possible that the developer does not use Django's
  :func:`django.contrib.auth.authenticate` directly but there are plenty of
  cases where it is used indirectly e.g.:
  - In session-backed authentication.
  - By some third-party packages, such as Django REST Framework's
    authentication classes (see ``rest_framework.compat.authenticate``).
- Do not confuse ``django.contrib.auth``'s ``base_user.AbstractBaseUser``
  with ``models.AbstractUser`` (the latter is a subclass of the former).
- Although Django names these kind of backends as "Authentication Backends",
  they are also used for authorization (see
  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/auth/customizing/#handling-authorization-in-custom-backends).
- The setting ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` defines which backends are used.
